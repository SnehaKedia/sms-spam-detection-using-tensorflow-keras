# SMS Spam Detection using Deep Learning Techniques (Tensorflow 2 Keras API)

This is a binary classification problem to state if a SMS is either spam (1) or not spam (0).
We implement Dense Text Classifier, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) deep learning models in TensorFlow2 Keras API.

Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection The SMS (text) data was downloaded from UCI datasets. It contains 5,574 SMS phone messages. The data have already been marked as either spam or not spam (ham).
